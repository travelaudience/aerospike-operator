=== Bug Fixes

* None

== Changes in `0.10.1`

=== Deprecations

* Deprecated the `--admission-enabled` and the `--debug` flags. These will be removed in a future version.

=== Improvements

* Added support for Aerospike 4.3.0.8 and 4.3.0.10.
* Updated `aerospike/aerospike-client-go` to 1.35.2.

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug which caused the reconcile loop to block for long periods of time when pods entered an error state.
* Fixed a bug which caused Aerospike 4.3.0.2 and later not to start if `.spec.namespaces[0].memorySize` was not explicitly set.

== Changes in `0.10.0`

IMPORTANT: Before upgrading `aerospike-operator`, one **MUST** update the `aerospike-operator` https://github.com/travelaudience/aerospike-operator/blob/master/docs/examples/00-prereqs.yml#L15[cluster role] using, e.g., `kubectl apply -f docs/examples/00-prereqs.yml`. Failure to do so will result in a deffective installation of `aerospike-operator`.

=== Breaking changes

* Dropped support for Kubernetes 1.10.

=== Improvements

* Promoted the API to `aerospike.travelaudience.com/v1alpha2`.
** Existing `aerospike.travelaudience.com/v1alpha1` resources are automatically converted to the new version when `aerospike-operator` starts.
** One is strongly adivsed to update their manifests to reflect this change (i.e. replacing `v1alpha1` with `v1alpha2`).
** The `aerospike.travelaudience.com/v1alpha1` API is being deprecated, and will be permanently disabled in a future version.
* Added the `secretNamespace` and `secretKey` fiels to <<./docs/design/api-spec.adoc#backupstoragespec,BackupStorageSpec>>. This allows the secrets used to backup/restore to/from cloud storage to exist in a Kubernetes namespace different from the one holding the AerospikeCluster resource.
* Added the https://www.aerospike.com/docs/reference/configuration/#data-in-memory[`data-in-memory`] field to <<./docs/design/api-spec.adoc#storagespec,StorageSpec>>.
* Added https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#additional-printer-columns[additional printer colums] to `AerospikeCluster`, `AerospikeNamespaceBackup` and `AerospikeNamespaceRestore`.
** Listing `AerospikeCluster` resources now displays version, node count and age.
** Listing `AerospikeNamespaceBackup` resources now displays target Aerospike cluster and namespace, as well as age.
** Listing `AerospikeNamespaceRestore` resources now displays target Aerospike cluster and namespace, as well as age.
* Added support for the `/scale` and `/status` subresources.
** It is now possible to scale an Aerospike cluster using `kubectl scale`.
* Added support for Aerospike 4.0.0.6, 4.1.0.6, 4.3.0.2, 4.3.0.4, 4.3.0.6 and 4.3.0.7.
* Updated `aerospike/aerospike-client-go` to 1.35.1.

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug which caused `.status.conditions` not to be reported in `AerospikeCluster` resources.

=== Documentation

* _Usage:_ Improved the <<./docs/usage/00-installation-guide.adoc#,Installation Guide>>.

=== Other

* _Tests_: Introduced the `GCS_SECRET_NAMESPACE` and `GCS_SECRET_KEY` environment variables.

== Changes in `0.9.0`

=== Breaking changes

* Change in the API in order to support deletion of PVCs by the garbage collector.
** Add `persistentVolumeClaimTTL` field to <<./docs/design/api-spec.adoc#storagespec,StorageSpec>>.
** **Action required:** Persistent volume claims created in previous versions of `aerospike-operator` will be replaced by new ones when a restart or upgrade operation is performed on an `AerospikeCluster` resource. To avoid losing data for Aerospike namespaces whose replication factor is equal to 1, one must create a backup of all Aerospike namespaces whose replication factor is equal to 1 _before_ upgrading `aerospike-operator`. Then, _after_ upgrading `aerospike-operator`, one must restore these backups to new Aerospike clusters.

=== Improvements

* Add support for deletion of expired resources via introduction of a <<./docs/design/garbage-collector.adoc#,garbage collector>>.
** Support deletion of expired PVCs.
** Support deletion of expired <<./docs/design/api-spec.adoc#aerospikeclusterbackupspec,AerospikeNamespaceBackups>>.
* Introduced `asinit` as a replacement to `sed`.
** The image for the init container has been switched from `busybox` to `quay.io/travelaudience/aerospike-operator-tools`.
* `aerospike-operator` will now wait for a node to join the existing cluster before proceeding with restarting the next node during a rolling-restart or upgrade procedure.
* Add support for Aerospike 4.2.0.10.
* Use `aerospike/aerospike-client-go` 1.35.0.

=== Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug which might under rare circumstances cause a node to form a separate cluster after being restarted.

=== Documentation

* _Design:_ Add the <<./docs/design/garbage-collection.adoc#,Garbage Collection>> design document.
* _Design:_ Updated the <<./docs/design/architecture.adoc#,Architecture>> design document.

== Changes in `0.8.0`

=== Breaking changes

* Change the naming strategy for persistent volume claims to use `GenerateName`.
** **Action required:** Persistent volume claims created in previous versions of `aerospike-operator` will be replaced by new ones when a restart or upgrade operation is performed on an `AerospikeCluster` resource. To avoid losing data for Aerospike namespaces whose replication factor is equal to 1, one must create a backup of all Aerospike namespaces whose replication factor is equal to 1 _before_ upgrading `aerospike-operator`. Then, _after_ upgrading `aerospike-operator`, one must restore these backups to new Aerospike clusters.

=== Improvements

* Add support for Kubernetes 1.11+.
* Add support for the https://www.aerospike.com/docs/operations/configure/namespace/storage/#recipe-for-an-ssd-storage-engine[`device`] (raw) storage type.
** Device storage requires a Kubernetes 1.11 cluster with alpha features enabled.
* Use Aerospike Tools 3.15.3.14.
* Use `aerospike/aerospike-client-go` 1.34.1.
* Support running custom upgrade steps via the introduction of <<./docs/design/upgrade-strategies.adoc#,upgrade strategies>>.
* Add support for Aerospike versions 4.0.0.4, 4.0.0.5, 4.1.0.1 and 4.2.0.5.

=== Documentation

* _Design:_ Add an <<./docs/design/upgrade-strategies.adoc#,Upgrade Strategies>> design document.

== Changes in `0.7.0`

=== Breaking changes

IMPORTANT: Before upgrading `aerospike-operator` to `0.7.0` or later, one should perform the actions indicated by the *_Action required_* items below as applicable.

* Enforce the existence of a single Aerospike namespace per Aerospike cluster.
  ** *Action required:* Existing `AerospikeCluster` resources with two Aerospike namespaces must be backed-up and restored to *two* new, separate Aerospike clusters with a *single* Aerospike namespace each.

=== Improvements

* Use stable node IDs for Aerospike nodes.
* Prevent Aerospike from trying to establish heartbeat connections to IP addresses of pods that don't exist anymore.
* Support operating on up to six Aerospike clusters simultaneously instead of only two.
* Prevent the `.status` field of an `AerospikeCluster` resource from being deleted. 
* Allow standby replicas of `aerospike-operator` to serve the validating admission webhook.
* Improving the handling of errors caused by the Kubernetes API forcibly closing open watch connections.
* Wait for endpoints for custom resource definitions to be available before starting the controllers.
* Improve logging when running with `--debug=false`.

=== Bug Fixes

* Fix panics that might occur if some optional fields were absent from a `AerospikeCluster` resource.

=== Documentation

* _Design:_ Make it clear that `.spec.backupSpec` is only required when one wants to upgrade an Aerospike cluster.
* _Design:_ Make it clear that `.spec.nodeCount` must be greater than or equal to `.spec.namespaces[*].replicationFactor`.
* _Design:_ Add an link:./docs/design/swagger.json[OpenAPI spec] for the `aerospike.travelaudience.com/v1alpha1` API.
* _Design/Usage:_ Address single namespace limitation. * _Usage:_ Briefly mention capacity planning as a precursor to the creation of `AerospikeCluster` resources.
* _Usage:_ Make it clear that the secret used for backups and restores must contain a `key.json` entry.
* _Usage:_ Fix the name of the `.spec.namespaces[*].storage.storageClassName` field.
* _Usage:_ Add a "quickstart" subsection to the <<./docs/usage/00-installation-guide.adoc#,Installation Guide>> page.
* _Examples:_ Add missing permissions to the example cluster role binding.
* _Examples:_ Specify resource requests and limits for `aerospike-operator` pods in the example deployment.
* _Other:_ Add links to `README.md` for better navigation. * _Other:_ Mention supported Aerospike versions in `README.md`. * _Other:_ List existing design documents in `README.md`.

=== Other

* _Tests:_ Run end-to-end tests using a separate Kubernetes service account.
